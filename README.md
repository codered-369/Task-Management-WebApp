This application allows you to manage tasks with a simple web interface. It includes a backend server to handle task storage and a frontend interface to interact with the tasks.

### Backend (`server.js`)

- **Dependencies**:
  - `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
  - `cors`: Middleware to enable CORS.
  - `path`: Core module to work with file and directory paths.

- **Setup**:
  - Initializes an Express server and sets up middleware for CORS, JSON parsing, and serving static files.
  - Stores tasks in an in-memory array (`tasks`).

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/tasks`: Fetches all tasks.
  - `POST /api/tasks`: Adds a new task.
  - `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Updates an existing task by ID.
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Deletes a task by ID.

- **Starting the Server**:
  - Listens on port 5000.

### Frontend (`app.js`)

- **API URL**:
  - `const apiUrl = 'http://localhost:5000/api/tasks';`: Base URL for the backend API.

- **Functions**:
  - `addTask()`: Adds a new task by sending a `POST` request to the server.
  - `displayTasks()`: Fetches and displays all tasks by sending a `GET` request.
  - `editTask(id)`: Edits an existing task by fetching its details and populating the input fields.
  - `deleteTask(id)`: Deletes a task by sending a `DELETE` request.

- **Initial Load**:
  - `displayTasks()`: Fetches and displays tasks when the page loads.

### How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

2. **Start the Backend Server**:
   - Run `node server.js` to start the server.
   OPen the browser and type "localhost:5000" to open the application.
